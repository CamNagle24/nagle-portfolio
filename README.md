# <a href="https://www.cameron-nagle.dev">My Developer Portfolio Website</a> ⚡️

### Welcome!
My portfolio site was built from a Youtube template, so I took notes on how a more experienced dev sets up front-end data flow for a static site. It was also my first time working with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Front End Development in general.

### What I Designed
- Icons for Coding Buttons
- Mobile/Media Query Screens
- Favicon
- Order & Sizing of Sections
- Colors
- Fonts

### What I Learned
- How to deploy a website
- Adding a favicon
- Basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Header, footers, and sections
- Hard Coding Files Instead of Using Libraries/Frameworks


### Thanks
